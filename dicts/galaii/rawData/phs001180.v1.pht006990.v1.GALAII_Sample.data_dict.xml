Samples are the final preps submitted for genotyping, sequencing, and/or expression data. For example, if one patient (subject ID) gave one sample, and that sample was processed differently to generate 2 sequencing runs, there would be two rows, both using the same subject ID, but having 2 unique sample IDs. The data table also includes sample aliases, the substudy (phs) accession that the sample belongs to, and sample use.</description><variable id="phv00320624.v1"><name>SUBJECT_ID</name><description>Subject ID of Phenotype Data</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00320625.v1"><name>SAMPLE_ID</name><description>Sample ID</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00320626.v1"><name>SAMPLE_SOURCE</name><description>Source repository where samples were genotyped</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00320627.v1"><name>SAMPLE_USE</name><description>Sample Use</description><type>encoded values</type><value code="Array_SNP">SNP genotypes obtained using standard or custom microarrays</value></variable><variable id="phv00320628.v1"><name>STUDY</name><description>DbGaP substudy accession</description><type>string</type></variable></data_table>
