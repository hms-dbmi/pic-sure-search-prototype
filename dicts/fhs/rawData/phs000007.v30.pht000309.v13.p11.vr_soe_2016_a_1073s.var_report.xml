There is a more detailed coding manual at the bottom of the SOE protocol for this dataset. Each event is a separate record in this file. If a unique study participant has two or more events with the same date value, the order of events in the dataset does not necessarily reflect the natural order of events. This dataset is generated annually. Included are events reviewed on or before 12/2016. Events reviewed after 12/2016 will appear in the next annual update. Events can take up to two years to be reviewed after they become known. This file does not represent follow up through 12/2016. The corresponding survival file contains follow up information and lags one year behind. This dataset replaces dataset vr_soe_2015_a_0991s.</description><variable id="phv00036472.v12.p11" var_name="shareid" calculated_type="string" reported_type=""><description>Unique study participant identification number</description><total><subject_profile><sex><male>3946</male><female>4011</female></sex></subject_profile><stats><stat n="18704" nulls="0"/></stats></total></variable><variable id="phv00036472.v12.p11.c1" var_name="shareid" calculated_type="string" reported_type=""><description>Unique study participant identification number</description><total><subject_profile><sex><male>3439</male><female>3402</female></sex></subject_profile><stats><stat n="15995" nulls="0"/></stats></total></variable><variable id="phv00036472.v12.p11.c2" var_name="shareid" calculated_type="string" reported_type=""><description>Unique study participant identification number</description><total><subject_profile><sex><male>505</male><female>607</female></sex></subject_profile><stats><stat n="2704" nulls="0"/></stats></total></variable><variable id="phv00036469.v12.p11" var_name="EVENT" calculated_type="enum_integer" reported_type=""><description>Event Number</description><comment>For EVENT = 1 - 5 MI: Recognized means at time of MI occurrence, an MI was known to have taken place.
