There is a more detailed coding manual at the bottom of the SOE protocol for this dataset. There is the possibility that there are duplicate records. Each event is a separate record in this file. If a unique ID has two or more events with the same date value, the order of events in the dataset does not necessarily reflect the natural order of events. This dataset is to be used in conjunction with the 2014 CVD and Death Survival datasets (vr_survcvd_2014_a_1023s and vr_survdth_2014_a_1025s). For more recent cardiovascular events without follow-up time, use the most recent SOE dataset, vr_soe_2015_a_0991s.</description><variable id="phv00190978.v6.p11" var_name="shareid" calculated_type="string" reported_type=""><description>Unique study participant identification number</description><total><subject_profile><sex><male>3842</male><female>3893</female></sex></subject_profile><stats><stat n="18188" nulls="0"/></stats></total></variable><variable id="phv00190978.v6.p11.c1" var_name="shareid" calculated_type="string" reported_type=""><description>Unique study participant identification number</description><total><subject_profile><sex><male>3352</male><female>3303</female></sex></subject_profile><stats><stat n="15553" nulls="0"/></stats></total></variable><variable id="phv00190978.v6.p11.c2" var_name="shareid" calculated_type="string" reported_type=""><description>Unique study participant identification number</description><total><subject_profile><sex><male>489</male><female>588</female></sex></subject_profile><stats><stat n="2631" nulls="0"/></stats></total></variable><variable id="phv00190979.v6.p11" var_name="EVENT" calculated_type="enum_integer" reported_type=""><description>Event Number</description><comment>For EVENT = 1 - 5 MI: Recognized means at time of MI occurrence, an MI was known to have taken place.
