The study includes FHS Original Cohort hip fractures confirmed through December 31, 2009. All confirmed Original Cohort hip fractures are in this file (including so-called traumatic hip fractures with circumstances other than a fall from standing height or less). The hip fracture ascertainment procedures were developed as part of the Framingham Osteoporosis Study, and first described in: Kiel DP, Felson DT, Anderson JJ, Wilson PW, Moskowitz MA. Hip fracture and the use of estrogens in postmenopausal women. The Framingham Study. N Engl J Med 1987 Nov 5;317(19):1169-74. Attempts were made to verify all reported hip fractures by medical record review. Sources included: x-ray or MRI report, orthopedic, consulting physician or nursing home notes, operation room (OR) or emergency room (ER) reports, discharge summaries. The Framingham Osteoporosis Study (FOS), an ancillary study of the Framingham Heart Study, has contributed substantially to the understanding of risk factors for age-related bone loss and fractures in men and women. For the past twenty years, this research program has been investigating a variety of risk factors for bone loss and fractures.</description><unique_key phv="00089419" version="2">shareid</unique_key><unique_key phv="00089414" version="2">Q2</unique_key><unique_key phv="00089418" version="2">fxdate</unique_key><variable id="phv00089419.v2"><name>shareid</name><description>Unique study participant identification number</description><coll_interval>Cases reviewed through July 2012</coll_interval></variable><variable id="phv00089414.v2"><name>Q2</name><description>Side of fracture</description><coll_interval>Cases reviewed through July 2012</coll_interval><value code="1">Right side</value><value code="2">Left side</value><value code=".">Unknown</value></variable><variable id="phv00089415.v2"><name>Q3</name><description>Hip fracture location</description><coll_interval>Cases reviewed through July 2012</coll_interval><value code="1">Intertrochanteric</value><value code="2">Neck of femur (subcapital)</value><value code="3">Other</value><value code=".">Unknown</value></variable><variable id="phv00089416.v2"><name>Q6</name><description>Circumstances of hip fracture</description><coll_interval>Cases reviewed through July 2012</coll_interval><value code="1">Fall from standing height or less</value><value code="2">Motor vehicle accident or fall from greater than standing height</value><value code="3">Other</value><value code=".">Unknown</value></variable><variable id="phv00089417.v2"><name>idtype</name><description>Framingham Heart Study cohort identifier</description><coll_interval>Cases reviewed through July 2012</coll_interval><value code="0">Original Cohort</value></variable><variable id="phv00089418.v2"><name>fxdate</name><description>Date of hip fracture</description><unit>days</unit><logical_min>195</logical_min><logical_max>21851</logical_max><comment>Number of days since Exam 1</comment><coll_interval>Cases reviewed through July 2012</coll_interval></variable><has_coll>1</has_coll></data_table>
