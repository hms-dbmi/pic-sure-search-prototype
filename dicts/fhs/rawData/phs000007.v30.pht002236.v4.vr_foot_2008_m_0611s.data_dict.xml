The Framingham Foot Study, an ancillary study of the FHS, is an observational cohort study of adults to examine the role of foot disorders upon functional limitations and disability. Hallux valgus was measured as part of the Foot Assessment Clinical Tool, which is a validated foot exam with specific criteria to assess foot pain, foot symptoms and presence of foot disorders. Trained clinical examiners performed all foot exams. Hallux valgus was considered to be present if the angle of the hallux towards the lesser toes was observed to be greater than 15 degrees. Pes cavus was defined using a weight-bearing ratio of arch width to rear-foot width from a bipedal stance on a computerized pressure mat. We defined pes cavus for a person as having a ratio of arch width to rear-foot width of 0, on either foot, identified by the ratio of the arch of the foot.</description><variable id="phv00159553.v3"><name>shareid</name><description>Framingham Heart Study participant SHARe ID number</description><coll_interval>Exam dates from 12/2000 to 6/2008</coll_interval></variable><variable id="phv00159554.v3"><name>idtype</name><description>Framingham Heart Study cohort identifier</description><coll_interval>Exam dates from 12/2000 to 6/2008</coll_interval><value code="0">Original Cohort</value><value code="1">Offspring Cohort</value></variable><variable id="phv00159556.v3"><name>exam</name><description>Closest Framingham exam cycle</description><comment>The EXAM variable was assigned by comparing the foot study call back exam date (EXDATE) and the Framingham Heart Study exam date (data not in this dataset).
