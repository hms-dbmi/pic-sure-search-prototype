Participants were mailed a medication bag with a request to bring in all prescription and non-prescription medication to the clinic. The physician recorded all the medications during the clinic visit. These medications were then coded using the World Health Organization&amp;#39;s Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classifications. Information about the ATC classification system can be found at http://www.whocc.no/atcddd/. See protocol document for more details.</description><unique_key phv="00177892" version="4">shareid</unique_key><unique_key phv="00177894" version="4">medname</unique_key><unique_key phv="00177895" version="4">medstren</unique_key><unique_key phv="00177897" version="4">mednum</unique_key><unique_key phv="00177898" version="4">medper</unique_key><unique_key phv="00177899" version="4">medprn</unique_key><variable id="phv00177892.v4"><name>shareid</name><description>Unique study participant identification number</description><coll_interval>Generation 3 Exam 2, New Offspring Spouse Exam 2, Omni 2 Exam 2</coll_interval></variable><variable id="phv00177893.v4"><name>idtype</name><description>Framingham Heart Study cohort identifier</description><coll_interval>Generation 3 Exam 2, New Offspring Spouse Exam 2, Omni 2 Exam 2</coll_interval><value code="2">New Offspring Spouse Cohort</value><value code="3">Generation 3 Cohort</value><value code="72">Omni 2 Cohort</value></variable><variable id="phv00177894.v4"><name>medname</name><description>Medication name (character variable)</description><comment>1.
