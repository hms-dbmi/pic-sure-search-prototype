For flag = 4, RBP4 is the mean of RES1 and RES2 because all controls were done in  duplicate.  If RBP4 was below the lowest detectable limit of 0.224 ng/mL, then RBP4 was set at 0.2.  The value was then divided by 1000 to get the units of micrograms/mL.
		RBP4 values by flag are as follows:11.61 - 114.35 for flag = 117.15 - 64.38 for flag = 216.00 - 80.93 for flag = 324.74 - 39.06 for flag = 4. </comment><coll_interval>Generation 3 Exam 1, New Offspring Spouse Exam 1</coll_interval></variable><variable id="phv00156689.v5"><name>flag</name><description>Data Type Indicator</description><type>encoded</type><comment>When doing analysis, use flag = 1 and 2.
