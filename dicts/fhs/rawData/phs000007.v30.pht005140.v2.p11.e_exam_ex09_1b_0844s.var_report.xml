The examination included a physician-administered medical history interview (or for examinations that occurred outside the research clinic, a technician-administered interview), technician-administered questionnaires to assess cognitive and physical function, and clinical measurements (anthropometric measurements, ECG and physical performance measures). In addition participants underwent ankle-brachial blood pressure testing and pulmonary function testing. Participants completed self-administered questionnaires that asked about diet, sleep and health.</description><variable id="phv00254010.v2.p11" var_name="shareid" calculated_type="string" reported_type=""><description>Unique study participant identification number</description><total><subject_profile><sex><male>1193</male><female>1513</female></sex></subject_profile><stats><stat n="2706" nulls="0"/></stats></total></variable><variable id="phv00254010.v2.p11.c1" var_name="shareid" calculated_type="string" reported_type=""><description>Unique study participant identification number</description><total><subject_profile><sex><male>1138</male><female>1402</female></sex></subject_profile><stats><stat n="2540" nulls="0"/></stats></total></variable><variable id="phv00254010.v2.p11.c2" var_name="shareid" calculated_type="string" reported_type=""><description>Unique study participant identification number</description><total><subject_profile><sex><male>55</male><female>111</female></sex></subject_profile><stats><stat n="166" nulls="0"/></stats></total></variable><variable id="phv00254011.v2.p11" var_name="idtype" calculated_type="enum_integer" reported_type=""><description>Framingham Heart Study participant cohort identifier</description><comment>IDTYPE and ID taken together form the study participant's ID number.</comment><total><subject_profile><sex><male>1193</male><female>1513</female></sex></subject_profile><stats><stat n="2706" nulls="0" mean_count="1353" sd="1502" median_count="1353" min_count="291" max_count="2415"/><enum code="1" count="2415">Offspring</enum><enum code="7" count="291">Omni 1</enum></stats></total></variable><variable id="phv00254011.v2.p11.c1" var_name="idtype" calculated_type="enum_integer" reported_type=""><description>Framingham Heart Study participant cohort identifier</description><comment>IDTYPE and ID taken together form the study participant's ID number.</comment><total><subject_profile><sex><male>1138</male><female>1402</female></sex></subject_profile><stats><stat n="2540" nulls="0" mean_count="1270" sd="1428" median_count="1270" min_count="260" max_count="2280"/><enum code="1" count="2280">Offspring</enum><enum code="7" count="260">Omni 1</enum></stats></total></variable><variable id="phv00254011.v2.p11.c2" var_name="idtype" calculated_type="enum_integer" reported_type=""><description>Framingham Heart Study participant cohort identifier</description><comment>IDTYPE and ID taken together form the study participant's ID number.</comment><total><subject_profile><sex><male>55</male><female>111</female></sex></subject_profile><stats><stat n="166" nulls="0" mean_count="83" sd="73.54" median_count="83" min_count="31" max_count="135"/><enum code="1" count="135">Offspring</enum><enum code="7" count="31">Omni 1</enum></stats></total></variable><variable id="phv00254012.v2.p11" var_name="j002" calculated_type="enum_integer" reported_type=""><description>Health Care: 1st Examiner Prefix -
