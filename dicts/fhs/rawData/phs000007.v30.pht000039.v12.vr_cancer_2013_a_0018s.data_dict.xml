The goal of this dataset is to 1) identify, confirm and code all malignancies appearing among participants of every generation of the Framingham Heart Study, 2) describe relationships between already identified FHS risk factors and the development of malignancies among participants, and 3) describe interactions among risk factors, CVD, and cancer in the FHS population(s). Included are the codes for all FHS reviewed cases of primary cancers (malignant or in-situ), that have been verified by pathology reports, or occasionally by other clinical records, for all Framingham Heart Study participants in all cohorts who reported a tumor or cancer at an examination or on a health history survey. Excluded are cases described in pathology reports as benign tumors or tumors of borderline malignancy, or cases described as metastases from other primary cancers. Also excluded are recurrences of basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers; the first occurrence of each of these series is the only one included for any individual person.</description><unique_key phv="00010777" version="11">shareid</unique_key><unique_key phv="00010770" version="11">TOPO</unique_key><unique_key phv="00010771" version="11">LOCATION</unique_key><unique_key phv="00010772" version="11">HIST</unique_key><unique_key phv="00010773" version="11">BEHAVIOR</unique_key><unique_key phv="00010774" version="11">GRADE</unique_key><variable id="phv00010777.v11"><name>shareid</name><description>Unique study participant identification number</description><coll_interval>Cancer Cases Reviewed through September 2013</coll_interval></variable><variable id="phv00010767.v11"><name>IDTYPE</name><description>Framingham Heart Study cohort identifier</description><coll_interval>Cancer Cases Reviewed through September 2013</coll_interval><value code="0">Original Cohort</value><value code="1">Offspring Cohort</value><value code="2">New Offspring Spouse Cohort</value><value code="3">Generation 3 Cohort</value><value code="7">Omni 1 Cohort</value><value code="72">Omni 2 Cohort</value></variable><variable id="phv00010768.v11"><name>DIAG_TYP</name><description>Method of diagnosis -
