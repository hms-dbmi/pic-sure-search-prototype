Included are samples from WHI SHARe, GO-ESP, GARNET, CARe, PAGE, Imputation, WHIMS+, and BA23 CHD. Samples are the final preps submitted for genotyping, sequencing, or expression data. For example, if one patient (subject ID) gave one sample, and that sample was processed differently to generate 2 sequencing runs, there would be two rows, both using the same subject ID, but having 2 unique sample IDs. The data table also includes a mapping of sample IDs to other sample ID aliases, the substudy (phs accession) that the sample belongs to, and sample use.</description><variable id="phv00080444.v6"><name>SUBJID</name><description>WHI Subject ID</description><type>integer</type></variable><variable id="phv00080443.v5"><name>SAMPLE_ID</name><description>WHI Sample ID</description><type>integer</type></variable><variable id="phv00080744.v5"><name>SAMPLE_SOURCE</name><description>Source repository where samples originate (Coriell HapMap)</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00080745.v5"><name>SOURCE_SAMPLE_ID</name><description>Sample ID used in the Source Repository</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00161362.v6"><name>STUDY</name><description>DbGaP top-level study or substudy accession</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00161363.v4"><name>SAMPLE_USE</name><description>Sample use.
