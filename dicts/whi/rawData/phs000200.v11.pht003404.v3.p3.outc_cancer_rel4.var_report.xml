		ICD-O-2 codes were used for all cancers except Lymphoma and Leukemia. WHI used ICD-O-3 codes for those cancers. WHI used SEER 1988, 2nd edition rules when coding cancers, see the SEER coding section of the data prep/use document for details.

		When size doesnt make sense, this field is used for other purposes (e.g. Leukemias have no size, this field records AIDS status). Size is usually measured in mm, though it may vary by cancer type. Even for cancers that do have a size, not all values indicate an actual size (e.g. 2 for many cancers means '&lt;=2mm', but for breast cancer it means 'Mammographic diagnosis only, tumor not clinically palpable' ).
