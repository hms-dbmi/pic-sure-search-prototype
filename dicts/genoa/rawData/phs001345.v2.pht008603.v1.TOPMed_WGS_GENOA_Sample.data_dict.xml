Samples are the final preps submitted for genotyping, sequencing, and/or expression data. For example, if one patient (subject ID) gave one sample, and that sample was processed differently to generate 2 sequencing runs, there would be two rows, both using the same subject ID, but having 2 unique sample IDs.</description><variable id="phv00396964.v1"><name>SUBJECT_ID</name><description>De-identified Subject Identifier</description></variable><variable id="phv00396965.v1"><name>SAMPLE_ID</name><description>De-identified Sample Identifier</description></variable></data_table>
