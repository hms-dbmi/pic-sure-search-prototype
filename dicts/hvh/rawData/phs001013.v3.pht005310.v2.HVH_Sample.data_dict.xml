Samples are the final preps submitted for genotyping, sequencing, and/or expression data. For example, if one patient (subject ID) gave one sample, and that sample was processed differently to generate 2 sequencing runs, there would be two rows, both using the same subject ID, but having 2 unique sample IDs. The data table also includes sample use.</description><variable id="phv00259372.v2"><name>SUBJECT_ID</name><description>Subject ID</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00259373.v2"><name>SAMPLE_ID</name><description>Sample ID</description><type>string</type></variable><variable id="phv00259374.v2"><name>SAMPLE_USE</name><description>Sample Use</description><type>encoded values</type><value code="Array_SNP">SNP genotypes obtained using standard or custom microarrays</value></variable></data_table>
